These are the projects that I had to complete for Andrew Ng's Coursera course. Note that plagiarizing these projects violates Coursera's terms of service and can result in a deactivation of your account. Do them yourself, just as I did.

ex1 - Linear regression

ex2 - Logistic regression

ex3 - All vs one Logistic regression for recognizing handwritten numbers from the MINST dataset, feedfoward part of a Neural Network.
